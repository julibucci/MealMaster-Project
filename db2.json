      "strInstructions": "In a small bowl, combine smoked paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt. Whisk to combine. In a different bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk, and set aside. In a separate dish, combine the flour with milk powder, baking powder, and the spice mix. To create a shaggy crust/crumbles, add 2 tablespoons of the egg milk mixture to the dry flour mixture, and rub with your fingertips until the flour mixture is coarse. In a dutch oven or a deep fryer, preheat about 2 inches (if using a dutch oven) of oil to 350°F (180°C) degrees. If you’re using a deep fryer, you need to fill enough oil to reach the “minimum” line.In a dutch oven or a deep fryer, preheat about 2 inches (if using a dutch oven) of oil to 350°F (180°C) degrees.

If you’re using a deep fryer, you need to fill enough oil to reach the “minimum” line.To coat your chicken like Chick-Fil-A, dip each chicken cutlet in the egg/milk mixture allowing any excess to drip off. Then, dredge the cutlets in the flour mixture pressing down firmly for it to adhere to the chicken. Shake off excess. Drop your chicken cutlets into the hot oil. Fry for 4 minutes if the oil covers the entire cutlet. If using shallow frying, fry for 3-4 minutes per side. The chicken is ready when the internal temperature registers at 165°F (74°C) degrees. Transfer to a wire rack or on paper towels then top with cheese (American, Colby Jack, or Pepper Jack). To assemble, toast the hamburger buns with some butter, spread the chick-fil-a sauce on both sides of the bun. Top with pickles, lettuce, 2 tomato slices, fried chicken, and cheese. Close the sandwich and there you have it, the best ever fried chicken sandwich that tastes even better than Chick-FilA!",

Roll out dough: Put the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and form it into a ball. Sprinkle it with more flour if it’s too sticky. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the dough to 3/4-inch thickness. Cut it into rounds using a cutter, dipping the cutter into flour between each cut. Reroll any scraps as needed to make a dozen rounds in all. Step 4. Bake biscuits: Put the rounds on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops of each with cream using a pastry brush.

Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, halve and peel onion. Slice as thinly as possible until you have ¼ cup (½ cup for 4 servings); finely chop remaining onion. Peel and finely chop garlic. Halve lime; squeeze juice into a small bowl. Halve buns. Add 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) to a separate small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Brush onto cut sides of buns.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTo bowl with lime juice, add sliced onion, ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine; set aside to quick-pickle.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nHeat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds more. Add pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhile pork cooks, in a third small bowl, combine BBQ sauce, pickling liquid from onion, 3 TBSP ketchup (6 TBSP for 4 servings), ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4), and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4). Once pork is cooked through, add BBQ sauce mixture to pan. Cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened, 2-3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, toast buns in oven or toaster oven until golden, 3-5 minutes. Divide toasted buns between plates and fill with as much BBQ pork as you’d like. Top with pickled onion and hot sauce. Serve with sweet potato wedges on the side.",

Season both sides of each chicken breast with seasoned salt and a pinch of pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the boiling water with a few generous pinches of kosher salt. Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of  pasta water before draining the pasta.  Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board; allow it to rest. Turn the heat down to medium and dd the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken. Add the veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and butter (refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies are finished browning). Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the milk, heavy cream, and reserved pasta water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese and cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
